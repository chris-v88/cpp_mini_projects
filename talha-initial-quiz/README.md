## Question 1:
Write a C++ program which prompts the user to enter two integer values, stores them in variables named ‘a’ and ‘b’, calculates the following expressions and displays the results on screen. Output of your program must be presentable. You must use minimum possible number of parentheses for evaluating these expressions. 
1.	(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2      
2.	(a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2         
3.	(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3          
4.	(a - b)3 = a3 - 3a2b + 3 ab2 - b3          
5.	a2 - b2 = (a - b) (a + b)          
6.	a3 - b3 = (a - b)3 + 3 a b (a - b)      
7.	a3 - b3 = (a - b) (a2 + a b + b2)         
8.	a3 + b3 = (a + b) (a2 - a b + b2)  
9.	a3 + b3 = (a + b)3 - 3 a b (a + b) 

## Question 2:
Write a C++ program which takes a character input from user and tells if it is a digit or not. If it is a digit, your program should tell if it is even or odd. If it is not a digit, your program should tell if it is an alphabet or not. If it is an alphabet, your program should tell if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is not an alphabet, your program should print “It is a special symbol”.

## Question 3: 
Company ‘CarsNLoans’ offers car loans to its customers. Every year, the company spends thousands of rupees for printing the tariff brochures. It is now planning to cut down on this expenditure by making a small computer application available to its customers using which the customers can calculate the monthly installment rates. You have been asked to write a C++ code for this application. Your program should prompt the user to enter values of the following parameters. 
•	Vehicle Price (Total cost of car) 
•	Down Payment (First payment made while purchasing the car) 
•	Installment Months (Number of months for which loan is required) 
 
Here is the method to calculate “Monthly Installments”. 
•	Payable Amount = Vehicle Price – Down Payment 
•	New Payable Amount = (Payable Amount + (Payable Amount* Interest Rate)) 
•	Monthly Installment = New Payable Amount / Installment Months 
 
Interest Rate is applicable as below; 
Installment Months 	Interest Rate 
Less than or equal to 12 	10% of Payable amount 
Greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 	15% of Payable amount 
Greater than 24 and less than or equal to 36 	20% of Payable amount 
Greater than 36 and less than or equal to 48 	25% of Payable amount 
Greater than 48 and less than or equal to 60 	30% of Payable amount
